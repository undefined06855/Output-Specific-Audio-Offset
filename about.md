# Output Specific Audio Offset
by [undefined0](user:13351341)

---

This mod simply saves output offsets depending on the output device, automatically switching when you change the output audio device.

If you switch between different headphones or speakers and they all provide a different latency, this is the mod for you!

To set the offset for a device, simply switch to it in your Windows or MacOS settings and then set an audio offset in-game, and the mod will automatically remember it.

Note: This mod may not work with the mod Settings+, since the offsets will not be saved when exiting the settings menu. However, if you disable the mod, set your offsets, and re-enable the mod they will both function fine.
